            <p>A must visit place in Madurai, Gandhi Memorial museum is housed in the splendid old palace of Rani Mangammal. The museum is a window to the glorious episodes of freedom struggles, glimpses from the Gandhian movement and a rich collection of relics.</p>

The palace which now houses the museum was built during the Naick reign in 1670 AD. A replica of a hut in Sevagram sits in front of the main building of the museum.</p>
