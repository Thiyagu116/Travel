        <h4 style={{marginTop:50}}>Thanjavur</h4>
        <p style={{marginTop:30}}>Thanjavur has been under the reign of various dynasties including the Cholas, Pandyas, Nayaks, Vijayanagara Kings and the Marathas, subsequently falling under the rule of the British. Every kingdom left its own indelible legacy that can be seen in every nook and corner of the town today. Their rich patronage to paintings, dance and music has made Thanjavur a destination of cultural exuberance. 
</p>
        <p >Stretches of temples that speak volumes about the brilliance of Dravidian architecture â€“ that is what Thanjavur is in one glimpse. However this historic city is much more than that. Arrive at the destination and be wondered about the breadth of lush green paddy fields that offer an absolute feast to the eyes.
</p>
        <p>Thanjavur is one destination where you get to see an abundance of them; most of them being stunning architectural wonders that carry the glory of their plush past to this day. </p>
